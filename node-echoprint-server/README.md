# node-echoprint-server #

A node.js music identification server that is compatible with the 
[Echoprint](http://echoprint.me/) music fingerprinting client. This server is 
based on the original 
[echoprint-server](https://github.com/echonest/echoprint-server) but attempts 
to improve on ease of installation, speed, matching accuracy, and ease of 
development/debugging.

## Dependencies ##

* [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - Tested with 0.6.10
* [MySQL](http://mysql.com/) - Tested with 5.5.20

To generate audio fingerprints you will need the 
[echoprint-codegen](https://github.com/echonest/echoprint-codegen) client.

## Installation ##

Clone this repository, enter the `node-echoprint-server` directory and run 
`npm install` to fetch the required dependencies. Import the `mysql.sql` file 
into your MySQL database. Next, copy `config.local.js.orig` to 
`config.local.js` and modify it to suit your environment. Make sure the 
database settings point to the MySQL database you just imported. Finally, run 
`node index.js` to start the server.

## Usage ##

The server will listen on the port configured in `config.local.js` and exposes 
two API endpoints.

### POST /ingest

Adds a new music fingerprint to the database if the given fingerprint is 
unique, otherwise the existing track information is returned.

Required fields:

* `code` - The code string output by echoprint-codegen
* `version` - metadata.version field output by echoprint-codegen
* `length` - Length in seconds of the track. duration field output by 
   echoprint-codegen

Optional fields:

* `track` - Name of the track
* `artist` - Track artist

The response is a JSON object containing `track_id`, `track`, `artist_id`, 
`artist` on success or `error` string on failure.
 
### GET /query?code=...&version=...

Queries for a track matching the given fingerprint. `code` and `version` 
query parameters are both required. The response is a JSON object 
containing a `success` boolean, `status` string, `match` object on 
successful match, or `error` string if something went wrong.

### GET /debug

The /debug endpoint can be visited in a browser and provides a human-friendly 
way of querying for a match and observing results. Here is a screenshot of the 
debug interface in action:
